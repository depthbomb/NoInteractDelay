# NoInteractDelay

A simple mod that removes the "cooldown" between interacting with objects. This includes objects in the world (such as buttons, the company bell, etc.) and held objects (air horn, clown horn, etc.).

As far as I know this _shouldn't_ give you any sort of advantage, but if you fear it might then get your friends to install the mod as well.

This is my first attempt at, really, any type of video game modding so I decided to start small.
